-EFI on U-Boot
-=============
-This document provides information about the implementation of the UEFI API [1]
-in U-Boot.
-
-
-=========== Table of Contents ===========
-
-Motivation
-How do I get it?
-Status
-Future work
-
-
-Motivation
-----------
-
-With this API support in place, you can run any UEFI payload (such as the Linux
-kernel, grub2 or gummiboot) on U-Boot. This dramatically simplifies boot loader
-configuration, as U-Boot based systems now look and feel (almost) the same way
-as TianoCore based systems.
-
-How do I get it?
-----------------
-
-EFI support for 32bit ARM and AArch64 is already included in U-Boot. All you
-need to do is enable
-
-  CONFIG_CMD_BOOTEFI=y
-  CONFIG_EFI_LOADER=y
-
-in your .config file and you will automatically get a bootefi command to run
-an efi application as well as snippet in the default distro boot script that
-scans for removable media efi binaries as fallback.
-
-Status
-------
-
-I am successfully able to run grub2 and Linux EFI binaries with this code on
-ARMv7 as well as AArch64 systems.
-
-When enabled, the resulting U-Boot binary only grows by ~10KB, so it's very
-light weight.
-
-All storage devices are directly accessible from the uEFI payload
-
-Removable media booting (search for /efi/boot/boota{a64,arm}.efi) is supported.
-
-Simple use cases like "Plug this SD card into my ARM device and it just
-boots into grub which boots into Linux", work very well.
-
-
-Running HelloWord.efi
----------------------
-
-You can run a simple 'hello world' EFI program in U-Boot.
-Enable the option CONFIG_CMD_BOOTEFI_HELLO.
-
-Then you can boot into U-Boot and type:
-
-   > bootefi hello
-
-The 'hello world EFI' program will then run, print a message and exit.
-
-
-Future work
------------
-
-Of course, there are still a few things one could do on top:
-
-   - Improve disk media detection (don't scan, use what information we
-have)
-   - Add EFI variable support using NVRAM
-   - Add GFX support
-   - Make EFI Shell work
-   - Network device support
-   - Support for payload exit
-   - Payload Watchdog support
